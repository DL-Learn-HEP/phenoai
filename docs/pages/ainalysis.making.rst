Making your own AInalyses
=========================
Using the :mod:`phenoai.maker` module you can create your own AInalyses. The only thing you need for this is a trained estimator in either keras or scikit-learn. Use `Example 08 <examples.ex08_ainalysismaker_classifier.html>`_ or `Example 09 <examples.ex09_ainalysismaker_regressor.html>`_ as a template for your AInalysis creation script.

.. note:: In the near future we will create a tutorial on how to create your own AInalyses, so that you don't have to use the example anymore.
