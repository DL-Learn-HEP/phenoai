One of the stengths of PhenoAI is that it allows the storage and communication of high-dimensional results in the form of a trained machine learning algorithm: an AInalysis. To accomodate this we list below AInalyses that are open to the public for download.

.. attention:: Do you have an AInalysis that you want to make public through this website? Contact us! You can find our contact information on the `FAQ page <faq.html>`_.
