Example 07: Logging
===================
Text output of PhenoAI to screen and file is managed by the logger module. The
functions in het module that manage the output are called internally by PhenoAI
and are not intended to be called by the user. Other functions however configure
the handling of the output and *are* specifically meant to be used by the user.
This example showcases the possibilities.
