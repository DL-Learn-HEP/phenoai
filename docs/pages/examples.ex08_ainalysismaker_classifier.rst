Example 08: Making a classification AInalysis
=============================================
Apart from being able to read and use AInalyses, PhenoAI also implements a module
to create new AInalyses from an existing estimator or to alter an existing
AInalysis. This module, the maker module, is used in this example to create
an AInalysis that implements a classifier. The exact application case is generated
randomly by scikit-learn, the code is only meant as a show case for how to use
the AInalysisMaker class to create classification AInalyses.
