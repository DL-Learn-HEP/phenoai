Example 03: Configuring an AInalysis
====================================
AInalyses consist, at minimum, out of a machine learning algorithm and a configuration
file. This configuration defines how data is handled before and after it is subjected
to the ML algorithm. It is therefore important to know what this configuration defines
exactly. Although the configuration file is written in the human-readable .yaml
format, this script shows you how to inspect the configuration via PhenoAI itself.

.. attention:: In order for this script to work, you need to run :download:`the initialisation script <../_static/examples/ex00_RUN_THIS_FIRST.py>` in the folder you will store the example scripts first.
