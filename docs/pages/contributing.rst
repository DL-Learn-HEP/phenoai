Contributing
============
Do you maybe want to contribute to PhenoAI or the AInalyses? Great! We are always looking for people who are willing to help us develop the software further.

You can contribute your own AInalyses to the library by contacting us (see the `FAQ <faq.html>`_ for contact details) about it. If you want to contribute to the codebase of PhenoAI, we recommend you to first go and have a look at our Github project page at `<https://github.com/bstienen/phenoai>`_. There you can find the most recent version of the code, see all open issues and engange with us through the discussion forum.
