Example 05: Reading results from individual AInalyses
=====================================================
The results of a prediction of an AInalysis are stored in AInalysisResults objects.
To increase the speed of PhenoAI, these objects store only the bare minimum of
information and calculate extra information when asked. In order to access all
possible information from the prediction routines, a good knowledge of the
AInalysisResults' interface is therefore needed. This example script showcases the
possibilities that this interface offers.

.. attention:: In order for this script to work, you need to run :download:`the initialisation script <../_static/examples/ex00_RUN_THIS_FIRST.py>` in the folder you will store the example scripts first.
